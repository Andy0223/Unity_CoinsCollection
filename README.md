## Explanation of Core Gameplay Mechanics
- The game starts with a 10-second initial time limit. After that, the game time starts counting down. During the game, move the main character to collect additional seconds by colliding with coins (each coin adds 2 seconds). The objective is to collect all coins within the allotted time; otherwise, it results in failure.
- If the player collides with pink spikes during the game, it also leads to failure.
